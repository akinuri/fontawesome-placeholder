# image-placeholder
 
A tool to quickly generate entity images (placeholders).

I've been creating images that represent an entities in an application, and as the entities/applications increases, this process (creating/modifying) becomes time consuming. This is an attempt to solve this issue.

It's using font icons from FontAwesome.
